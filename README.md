Deploy the Application

    Step 1: Deploy in the development environment first by running the pipeline with terraform apply.
    Step 2: After successful verification, promote the application to staging by running the same pipeline with the staging environment's terraform.tfvars.
    Step 3: Promote to production after successful testing in staging.
    
Each environment (dev, staging, prod) will have its own isolated infrastructure (including databases, EC2 instances, etc.). This isolation is achieved through:

Separate State Files: Store the Terraform state for each environment in different remote backends (e.g., separate S3 buckets or workspaces).
Environment-Specific Variables: Different values for each environment in terraform.tfvars.
For instance, you can configure different workspaces for each environment in Terraform:
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod

Best Practices and Cost Optimization
Security Best Practices

    Use IAM roles with the principle of least privilege.
    Use AWS KMS to encrypt RDS databases and S3 buckets.
    Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical operations.
    Set up security groups to restrict access to EC2 and RDS only from necessary IP addresses.

Cost Optimization

    Use Spot Instances for non-production environments (development, staging).
    Implement Auto Scaling for EC2 instances in production environments.
    Use AWS Trusted Advisor to identify cost-saving opportunities.
